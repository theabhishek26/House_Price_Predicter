## Introduction

This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. It is designed to help users understand the factors influencing house prices and build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a house based on its features.

---

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset for training.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Includes regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use scripts for training and prediction.
- **Scalable**: Can be extended to include more features or models.

## Installation

To get started with the House Price Predictor, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theabhishek26/House_Price_Predicter.git
   cd House_Price_Predicter
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the project**:
   - For training the model:
     ```bash
     python train.py
     ```
   - For making predictions:
     ```bash
     python predict.py
     ```

---

## Usage

### Training the Model
To train the model, run the `train.py` script. This will preprocess the data, train the model, and save it for future use.

```bash
python train.py
```

### Making Predictions
To make predictions using the trained model, run the `predict.py` script. You can input the features of a house, and the model will predict its price.

```bash
python predict.py
```

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is included in the `data/` directory. It contains the following features:

- **Location**: The area where the house is located.
- **Size**: The size of the house in square feet.
- **Rooms**: The number of rooms in the house.
- **Age**: The age of the house.
- **Price**: The target variable (price of the house).

You can replace the dataset with your own data for custom predictions.

---

## Model

The project uses a **Linear Regression** as the primary model for predicting house prices.

You can experiment with other models by modifying the `train.py` script.
